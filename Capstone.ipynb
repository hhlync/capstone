    "A client wants to open a café in Seoul as part of her retirement plan; she hired us to pick out the optimal location for her new business. The client requested that we pay special attention to the rent cost.   \n",

    "According to Hyundai Research Institute, coffee is a 5.7 billion dollar industry in South Korea. An average adult drinks 353 cups of coffee per year. Despite the high demand, coffee is a risky business, because the market is already saturated. Our client is one of many who wants to run a café after retirement. \n",

    "We consulted the advices given by commerical property experts in Seoul. Five suggestions were given: \n",
    "1. Although setting up a shop in a large commercial district guarantees revenue to an extent, the cost is too high. It is better to target the periphery of a growing commercial district with significant foot traffic and cheaper rent. \n",
    "2. It is a bad idea to set up a shop near malls, which provide better facilities than surrounding shops. People will likely walk past the cafe. \n",
    "3. Avoid a location with a competitor within 200-300m radius. \n",
    "4. Office complex or university nearby will boost the coffee business.\n",
    "5. Restuarants can be a plus as Koreans tend to go to a cafe after the restuarant. \n",
